We do not know the probability of the true mean.  \n\n(b) FALSE: We are 95% confident that $\\bar{x}$̄ is between 22 and 30 kg of milk per day. \nExplain: $\\bar{x}$ is always between 22-30kg. \n\n(c) FALSE: The mean milk production μ for cows in the state will be 22–30 kg/day\n95% of the time.  \n\n(d) TRUE: We are 95% confident that cows in this state produce, on average, between 22 and 30 kg milk per day.  \nExplain: This is the definition of confidence intervals.  \n\n(e) TRUE: In 95% of samples, the mean milk production will be between 22 to\n30 kg/day.  \n\n\n### Question 3\n(a) $\\bar{x}$ = 210  \n$\\alpha$ = 1 - .9 = .1 $\\Rightarrow$ $Z_{(1-.1/2)}$ = $Z_{.95}$ = 1.645  \n\n```{r}\n210 + 1.64 * 50/sqrt(100) #218.2\n210 - 1.64 * 50/sqrt(100) #201.8\n```\nWe are 90% confident that the true mean cholesterol level of adult men in this town is between 201.8 and 218.2  \n\n(b)  \n$q_{.975}$ = 1.96, in order to get ME $\\leq$ 10mg/dL, we set:  \n1.96*(50/$\\sqrt{n}$) $\\leq$ 10  \n$\\Leftrightarrow$ 5 * 1.96 $\\leq$ $\\sqrt{n}$ \n\n```{r}\n5*1.96\n9.8^2\n```\n\n$\\Leftrightarrow$ n $\\geq$ 96.04  \nWe should have at least 97 people in the sample.  \n\n(c)\n$q_{1-.01/2}$ = $q_{.995}$ = 2.58  \n$\\Leftrightarrow$ 2.58*(50/$\\sqrt{n}$) $\\leq$ 10  \n$\\Leftrightarrow$ 2.58*5 $\\leq$ $\\sqrt{n}$ \n\n```{r}\n5*2.58\n12.9^2\n```\n\n$\\Leftrightarrow$ n $\\geq$ 166.41   \nWe should have at least 167 people in the sample.  \n\n### Question 4  \n(a) In a 90% confidence interval (CI), 1 - $\\alpha$ = .9, so $\\alpha/2$ = .05.  \n$q_{.95}$, the $95^{th}$ quantile of t distribution with sample n, is: \n```{r}\nqt(0.95, 4) # n = 5\nqt(0.95, 14) # n = 15\nqt(0.95, 29) # n = 30\nqt(0.95, 99) # n = 100\nqnorm(.95) \n```\n\nAs df $\\textbf{increases}$, the closer the quantile of t distribution gets to the quantile of N(0, 1).  \n\n(b)  \nIn a 90% CI, 1 - $\\alpha$ = .9, so $\\alpha/2$ = .05. We will calculate $q_{.95}$.  \nIn a 95% CI, 1 - $\\alpha$ = .95, so $\\alpha/2$ = .025. We will calculate $q_{.975}$.  \nIn a 99% CI, 1 - $\\alpha$ = .99, so $\\alpha/2$ = .005. We will calculate $q_{.995}$.  \n\n```{r}\n# n = 15\nqt(0.95, 14) #90% CI\nqt(0.975, 14) #95% CI\nqt(0.995, 14) #99% CI\n```\n\nWhen n is fixed, the quantile of t distribution $\\textbf{increases}$ as confidence percentage $\\textbf{increases}$; in the above example, 90% CI has the narrowest interval while 99% CI has the widest interval.  \n\n### Question 9  \n```{r}\nurl <- getURL(\"http://www.calvin.edu/~scofield/data/csv/hesterberg/Spruce.csv\")\nSpruce <- read.csv(text = url)\n```\n\n(a)  \n```{r}\nfavstats(Ht.change, data = Spruce)\ndensityplot(~ Ht.change, data = Spruce, xlab = \"Change (cm) in height\")\nhistogram(~Ht.change, data = Spruce, xlab = \"Change (cm) in height\")\n```\n\n(b)\n```{r}\nt.test(Ht.change, data = Spruce)$conf\n```\nWe are 95% confident that the average height change of spruce seedlings after a 5-year period is between 28.34 and 33.53 cm.  \n\n### Question 13  \n(a)  \n```{r}\nfavstats(Ht.change~Fertilizer, data = Spruce)\ndensityplot(~Ht.change, groups = Fertilizer, data = Spruce, xlab = \"Change (cm) in height\",auto.key = TRUE)\nhistogram(~Ht.change|Fertilizer, data = Spruce, xlab = \"Change (cm) in height\")\n```\n\n(b)\n```{r}\nf <- subset(Spruce, select = Ht.change, subset = Fertilizer == \"F\", drop = T)\nnf <- subset(Spruce, select = Ht.change, subset = Fertilizer == \"NF\", drop = T)\nt.test(f - nf, conf.level = 0.95, alt = \"greater\")$conf\n```\nWe are 95% confident that the average height change in spruce seedlings with fertilizer is 12.108cm $\\textbf{higher}$ than the average height change in those with no fertilizer.  \n\n### Question 20  \n(a)  \n```{r}\nprop.test(459,980, conf.level = 0.95, correct = TRUE)$conf\n```\nWe are 95% confident that the proportion of women voting for Bush lies between 43.7% and 50%.  \n\n(b)\n```{r}\nprop.test(426,759, conf.level = 0.95, correct = TRUE)$conf\n```\nWe are 95% confident that the proportion of men voting for Bush lies between 52.5% and 59.7%.  \nSince (52.5, 59.7) does not intersect (43.7, 50), the 95% confidence intervals of men and women do not overlap. There are probably more men who vote for Bush than female who do.  \n\n(c)\n```{r}\nprop.test(c(426,459), c(759,980), conf.level = 0.95, correct = TRUE)$conf\n```\nWe are 95% confident that between 4.46% and 14.1% more male than female voting for Bush. \n\n### Question 28  \n(a)\nWith 95% confidence, the risk for sophomores to bringe drink is between 1.6 and 2.3 times higher than the same risk for seniors.  \n\n(b)  \nIf the confidence interval overlaps 0, then we do not have evidence to conclude that one group has higher risk than the other and vice versa.
