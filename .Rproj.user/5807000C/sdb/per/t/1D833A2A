This provides strong evidence that males eat more hotwings on average than females. \n\n**b)**\nThe first line of output says that given the average value of hotwings and the spread, we would be 95% confident that the true mean of the data is between 21.7 and 30.6\nThe second line of output says that if the data was put in order, the value 5% from the beginning would be 5.4 and the value 5% from the end would be 42.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nLoad the data:\n```{r}\nurl <- getURL(\"http://www.calvin.edu/~scofield/data/csv/hesterberg/NCBirths2004.csv\")\nncbirths <- read.csv(text = url)\n```\n\n**a)**\n\nHypotheses:\n$\\sf{H_{0}}$ = The proportion of giving birth to a female = 0.5\\newline\n$\\sf{H_{A}}$ = The proportion of giving birth to a female > 0.5\n\nAssumptions:\\newline\n-Independence both within and between samples\\newline\n-Large enough n (10 successes, 10 failures)\n\n\nTest Statistic:\n```{r}\nprop.test(~Gender, data=ncbirths, alt=\"greater\")\n```\nThe Test Statistic is 1.0149\n\nP-value:\\newline\nThe p-value is 0.1569\n\nInterpretation:\\newline\nThe is not sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore we do not have evidence to say that more than 50% of children born in North Carolina are female. \n\n**b)**\n\nHypotheses:\\newline\n$\\sf{H_{0}}$ = The weight of children with mothers who used alcohol is the same as the weight of children with mothers who did not use alcohol\\newline\n$\\sf{H_{A}}$ = The weight of children with mothers who used alcohol is different from the weight of children with mothers who did not use alcohol\\newline\n\nAssumptions:\\newline\n-With small samples, no outliers or skewness\\newline\n-Indepence both within and between \n\nTest Statistic:\n```{r}\nusedAlcohol <- subset(ncbirths, select = Weight, Alcohol==\"Yes\", drop= T)\nnoAlcohol <- subset(ncbirths, select = Weight, Alcohol==\"No\", drop= T)\nt.test(Weight~Alcohol, data=ncbirths)\n```\nThe test statistic is 0.323\n\nP-value:\\newline\nThe p-value is 0.7678\\newline\n\nInterpretation:\\newline\nThe is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we cannot say that children with mothers who drank weigh a different amount that children with mothers who did not drink. \n\n**c)**\n\nSince we failed to reject the null hypothesis, only a Type II error is possible\n\n**d)**\nFind the power of the test when mu is .55:\n```{r}\nse<- sqrt(521/1009*(488/1009)/1009)\n1-pnorm(((se*1.645+.513)-.55)/se)\n```\n\nThe power is 76%.\n\n##Problem 3\n\n**a)**\n\n```{r}\nxyplot(Weight~Gestation, data=ncbirths, main = \"Weight by Gestation\")\ncor(Weight~Gestation, data=ncbirths)\n```\n\n**b)**\n```{r}\nmodel1 <- lm(Weight~Gestation+Gender, data=ncbirths)\nsummary(model1)\n```\n\nInterpretation:\\newline\nGestation-One additional week of gestation results in a 149.75 additional grams in baby weight, on average.\\newline\nGenderMale - Male babies weigh, on average, 108.67 grams more than female babies.\n\n**c)**\n```{r}  \n149.75-1.96*(12.54)\n149.75+1.96*(12.54)\n```\n\nA 95% confidence interval for the slope of gestation is 124.3 to 173.7\n  \n**d)**\nLinearity and Constant Variability\n```{r}\nxyplot(residuals(model1)~Gestation, data=ncbirths)\n```\n\nNearly normal residuals:\n```{r}\nhistogram(~residuals(model1), fit=\"normal\")\nqqnorm(model1$residuals)\nqqline(model1$residuals)\n```\n\nThe data appears to be linear, meet the constant variability condition, and have nearly normal residuals. Therefore, it meets the assumptions for a least-squares regression model\n\n**e)**\n\n```{r}\nncbirths$Gestation.sq <- ncbirths$Gestation^2\nmodel2 <- lm(Weight~Gestation+Gestation.sq+Gender, data=ncbirths)\nsummary(model2)\n```\n\n**f)**\n\n```{r}\nAIC(model1)\nAIC(model2)\n```\nModel 2, the model from part e, has a slightly lower Akaike Information Criterion and is therefore preferred.\n\n**g)**\nGestation.sq is significant at the 1% level. This means that it has a real effect on baby weight. In particular, baby weight goes up as gestation increases because the positive coefficient on gestation is greater than that of gestation.sq. However, if a baby has a gestation period that is too high, than the weight of the baby decreases. Practically, this means that babys are heaviest if they are not born too early or too late.",
